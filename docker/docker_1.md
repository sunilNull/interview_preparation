Certainly! Here are 100 questions and answers related to Docker, covering basic, intermediate, advanced concepts, security, and more.

### Basic Docker Concepts

1. **What is Docker?**
    - Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files.

2. **What is a container?**
    - A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

3. **What is Docker Hub?**
    - Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where you can find and share container images with your team or the Docker community.

4. **What is a Dockerfile?**
    - A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

5. **What is a Docker image?**
    - A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container. It includes the application code, libraries, dependencies, and the runtime needed to run the application.

6. **How do you create a Docker container?**
    - You can create a Docker container using the `docker run` command.
      ```sh
      docker run -d --name mycontainer myimage
      ```

7. **How do you list all Docker containers?**
    - Use the `docker ps` command to list running containers and `docker ps -a` to list all containers.
      ```sh
      docker ps
      docker ps -a
      ```

8. **What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?**
    - `docker run` creates and starts a new container from an image, while `docker start` starts an existing stopped container.

9. **How do you stop a running container?**
    - Use the `docker stop` command followed by the container ID or name.
      ```sh
      docker stop mycontainer
      ```

10. **How do you remove a Docker container?**
    - Use the `docker rm` command followed by the container ID or name.
      ```sh
      docker rm mycontainer
      ```

11. **How do you remove a Docker image?**
    - Use the `docker rmi` command followed by the image ID or name.
      ```sh
      docker rmi myimage
      ```

12. **What is Docker Compose?**
    - Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You define your application’s services, networks, and volumes in a `docker-compose.yml` file, and then you can start your application with a single command.

13. **How do you build a Docker image from a Dockerfile?**
    - Use the `docker build` command followed by the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
      ```sh
      docker build -t myimage .
      ```

14. **What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?**
    - A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. A container is a running instance of an image.

15. **What are Docker volumes?**
    - Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data created by and used by Docker containers.

### Intermediate Docker Concepts

16. **How do you view the logs of a Docker container?**
    - Use the `docker logs` command followed by the container ID or name.
      ```sh
      docker logs mycontainer
      ```

      ```sh
      docker inspect mycontainer
      ```

18. **What is a Docker network?**
    - A Docker network allows containers to communicate with each other, providing network isolation. Docker provides different network drivers like bridge, host, overlay, and macvlan.

19. **How do you create a custom Docker network?**

      ```

22. **What is the purpose of the `EXPOSE` instruction in a Dockerfile?**
    - The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. It doesn't publish the ports to the host; it’s mainly for documentation purposes.

23. **How do you pass environment variables to a Docker container?**
    - Use the `-e` flag with `docker run` to pass environment variables.
      ```sh
      docker run -e VAR_NAME=value myimage

26. **How do you list Docker volumes?**
    - Use the `docker volume ls` command.
      ```sh
      docker volume ls
      ```

29. **How do you restart a Docker container?**
    - Use the `docker restart` command followed by the container ID or name.
      ```sh
      docker restart mycontainer
      ```

30. **What is the difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in a Dockerfile?**

31. **How do you run a Docker container in the background?**
    - Use the `-d` flag with `docker run` to run the container in detached mode.
      ```sh
      docker run -d myimage
      ```

      ```sh
      docker exec mycontainer command
      ```

34. **How do you set the working directory in a Dockerfile?**
    - Use the `WORKDIR` instruction in the Dockerfile.
      ```dockerfile
      WORKDIR /app
      ```

35. **How do you specify the base image in a Dockerfile?**
